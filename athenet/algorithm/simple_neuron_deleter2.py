    sender - SimplE Neuron DEleteR

    Deletes the least significant neurons.
    Outgoing value of neuron is defined as sum of absolute values of
    weights outgoing from neuron divided by sum of absolute values of
    weights outgoing from entire layer.
    Ingoing value of neuron is defined as sum of absolute values of
    weights ingoing from neuron divided by sum of absolute values of
    weights ingoing from entire layer.
    Neuron value is defined as multiplication of its ingoing and outgoing
    values.
