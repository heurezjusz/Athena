"""Functions for picking weights to be deleted in view of their cost.

Functions should behave as follows: Function receives:
    * neural network with 'cost of removal' of any value in network's weights
    * threshold telling how much cost we accept (or another config).
Then it puts zero in selected weights in order to modify more pixels and more
significant pixels but without exceeding the threshold.
